What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Creates hidden files to store metadata about change history / place to track version changes

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's not offically a recorded change yet but set to be recorded.  It allows coders to selectively choose what and when to update, putting numerous changes into discrete logical chucks.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

you can be selective about which files and/or lines of code to include in each commit
